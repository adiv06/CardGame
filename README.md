**A Texas Holdem Game Against a Computer**

This was a class project for an introduction to C# and WindowsForms. It is an entirely playable game that allows the user to bet different amounts based on the chips clicked. Furthermore, it will inform you if you had picked the best hand based on the "best 5" you picked to play against the computer. Also, I tried my best to make it look somewhat pretty! Hope whoever is reading this tries it out :)
